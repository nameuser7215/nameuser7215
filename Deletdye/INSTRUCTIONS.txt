Hello there
I'm here to guide you through this program.
The selection has not been selected yet, so you'll have to modify which file to delete.
But in the future, you'll be able to browse for the program.
Let's begin!
Right click on the batch file, and click on Edit
DO NOT CHANGE ANY CODE!!! ONLY CHANGE THE FILE YOU WANT TO DELETE!!! (you have to do it manually yourself.)
Once you do that, run the shortcut or batch filed.
The batch file must be stored inside the folder, otherwise the program will not work.
Good luck, mate.
