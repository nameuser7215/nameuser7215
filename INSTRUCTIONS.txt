Hello there
I'm here to guide you through this program.
The selection has not been selected yet, so you'll have to modify which file to delete.
But in the future, you'll be able to browse for the program.
Let's begin!
Right click on the batch file, and click on Edit [DO NOT CHANGE ANY CODE!!! ONLY CHANGE THE FILE YOU WANT TO DELETE!!! (you have to do it manually yourself.)]
On the edit menu, put the username you want to delete the file from.
Then place the file/folder you want to place on the "File/folder Input" part (you can specify a unwanted file on the folder)
Once you do that, run the shortcut or batch file.
The batch file must be stored inside the folder, otherwise the program will not work.
Good luck, mate.
