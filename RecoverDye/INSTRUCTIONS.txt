Hello there
I'm here to guide you through this program.
The selection has not been selected yet, so you'll have to modify which file/folder to add onto their specfic folders or anywhere.
But in the future, you'll be able to browse for the program.
Let's begin!
Right click on the batch file, and click on Edit [DO NOT CHANGE ANY CODE!!! ONLY CHANGE THE FILE YOU WANT TO DELETE!!! (you have to do it manually yourself.)]
On the edit menu, put the username you want to add the file to.
Look for the part of the folder you want to add the file. Yes, you cannot add other types of files, only folders.
Once you do that, run the shortcut or batch file.
The batch file must be stored inside the folder, otherwise the program will not work.
Good luck, mate.
